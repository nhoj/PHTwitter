* Fetch Tweets
    - Tweets will be displayed on the screen from latest to the earliest tweets. It fetches 10 rows at a time.
    - NOTE:     > If streaming is ongoing, there may be tweets that will be newer to the latest tweet on the screen. 
                > If you prefer to get the latest everytime, just refresh the page and click the "Fetch Tweets" again.

MISCELLANEOUS


EDIT TWITTER REPLY MESSAGES

EDIT SEARCH TERMS
- Search terms are found in twitter/twitter-search-terms.txt

===============================================================================


CAVEATS

* If you keep the streaming active, you may run out of disk space. You may also be banned from Twitter for some time.
* Replying to a tweet only removes it on the screen and NOT on the database. 
    - This is to check for duplicate users
    - So, eventually, it needs to remove the "old" data in the database.... NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION.
